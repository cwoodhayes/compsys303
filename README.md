# compsys303
Dallas and Conor's COMPSYS303 labs and assignments.

These two assignments were written and completed entirely by my lab partner and I for
the Advanced Embedded Systems course I took while studying abroad at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

The projects were developed, implemented, and tested using the NIOSII softessor, loaded onto an Altera FPGA.

The FSM code (see the tick() function) for the second project was generated using the Kieler SCCharts software,
which allows the designer to specify a FSM in the synchronous SCCharts language, guaranteeing safe, predictable
execution of an embedded system requiring synchronous input processing/output generation.  This is important,
considering that the project was to design a pacemaker. ;)

Since the projects for the course aren't repeated, and I'm nowhere near Auckland now, I'm making this repo--
which I maintained to help organize our work--public.
